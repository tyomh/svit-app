----- Java ----
Define and execute three tasks(e.g task1, task2, task3) 
	- task1 starts with initial delay 1 seconds, and 1 seconds delay subsequently delay between the termination of last execution and the next execution；
 	- task2 starts with initial delay 2 seconds, and 2 seconds delay subsequently delay between the termination of last execution and the next execution；
 	- task3 starts with initial delay 3 seconds, and 3 seconds delay subsequently delay between the termination of last execution and the next execution；
 	Each task runs again and again until cancellation or termination. If any execution of the task encounters an exception, subsequent executions are suppressed. 
   	Hint: use Java's ScheduledExecutorService and scheduleAtFixedRate method.

----- Algorithm----- Please practice following algorithms via leetcode and/or eclipse with input example 
1) Binary tree traversal : 
	- bottom-up level order print
	- Zigzag Level order print
  
2) print matrix diagonal 
  
  1  2  3  4 
  5  6  7  8 
  9 10 11 12
  13 14 15 16
  
  [1], [2, 5], [3, 6, 9] [4, 7, 10, 13] ...
  
3) Write a method to return all subsets of a set
	e.g input: [1,2,3]
 		output: [[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
